# MultipleChoice
Template for multiple choice tests

The idea behind this script is to enable creating multiple choice tests in a simple and fast way
You just need to add the questions and the answers to the template and define how many questions from this set should be included in the test and then you're good to go: both the student version and the solution are generated in one go.
